# Magma workshop 

The idea is to hold an informal, friendly seminar/workshop to explore the computer algebra system [Magma](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/). Everyone is welcome to contribute, whether with talks, questions, exercises, solutions, or anything else you think might be useful.

## Problems

[Here](problems.md) we collect some questions, problems and exercises.
