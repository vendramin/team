Janis Gathot 

An introduction to quantum symmetry of graphs and a quantum version of Frucht's property  

We consider the notion of quantum symmetry for graphs - a non-commutative
generalisation of classical symmetry -, and discuss results on both quantum
automorphism groups and quantum isomorphisms of graphs. Also the notion of
graphs itself can be quantized. In this context we will discuss a quantum
version of Frucht's theorem, which in the classical case states that every
finite group appears as the automorphism group of some undirected connected
graph. If time allows it, we will also consider a characterization by Mančinska
and Roberson which states that determining quantum isomorphism of graphs is
equivalent to counting the number of homomorphisms from planar graphs.

[Andrea Sciandra](https://www.andreasciandra.com/home)  

Quantum Yang–Baxter equation, Yetter–Drinfeld braces, and semi-abelian categories  

In this talk, we show how to construct solutions of the quantum Yang–Baxter
equation from Yetter–Drinfeld braces, algebraic structures that generalize
cocommutative Hopf braces and are equivalent to matched pairs of actions on
Hopf algebras. We further prove that cocommutative Yetter–Drinfeld braces
(equivalently, cocommutative Hopf braces) form a semi-abelian category that is
also strongly protomodular, as is the case for the categories of groups, skew
braces, and cocommutative Hopf algebras. Moreover, under suitable assumptions
on the base field, we show that skew braces and post-Lie algebras can be used
to construct a torsion theory for this category. This talk is partially based
on a joint work with D. Ferri and on a joint work with M. Gran.

Lukas Simons 

Different definitions of Nichols algebras  

Nichols algebras are certain braided Hopf algebras that play an
important role in the theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups.
Originally introduced by Nichols, they have since revealed themselves
as rich objects with applications far beyond Hopf algebra theory. In
this talk, I will briefly outline the different definitions of Nichols
algebras and explain why these definitions are equivalent.

Constructing coset geometries with Magma  

We will discuss briefly what is available currently in the Incidence Geometry
and Coset Geometry package to work with incidence geometries and subclasses of
them as abstract regular polytopes, abstract chiral polytopes, hypertopes, etc.
We will present some usual problems that one encounters when developing
algorithms in Magma.

[Istvan Heckenberger](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/staff-info?dn=kqb1nhxgnl)

**Francqui VUB-Leerstoel Inaugural Lecture**. On some beautiful children of abstract algebra  

From time to time, abstract algebraic structures like Nichols algebras produce
during their studies interesting, rather elementary but non-trivial
mathematical structures. In the lecture I will demonstrate two of such
structures, frieze patterns of integers and the hyperplane geometry of Weyl
groupoids.

[Thomas Breuer](https://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/homes/Thomas.Breuer/)  

On the total degree of a finite group  

For a finite group $G$, the total degree $T(G)$ is defined as the sum of the
degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$.  We classify the groups
with $T(G) \leq 100$, using computational methods, and investigate special
cases such as groups of prime power order and groups with total degree the
square of a prime.  (This is joint work with László Héthelyi, Burkhard
Külshammer, and Magdolna Szöke.)
