On the total degree of a finite group  

Abstract:
For a finite group $G$, the total degree $T(G)$ is defined as the sum of the
degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$.  We classify the groups
with $T(G) \leq 100$, using computational methods, and investigate special
cases such as groups of prime power order and groups with total degree the
square of a prime.  (This is joint work with László Héthelyi, Burkhard
Külshammer, and Magdolna Szöke.)
