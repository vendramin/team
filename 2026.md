Quantum Yang–Baxter equation, Yetter–Drinfeld braces, and semi-abelian categories  

In this talk, we show how to construct solutions of the quantum Yang–Baxter
equation from Yetter–Drinfeld braces, algebraic structures that generalize
cocommutative Hopf braces and are equivalent to matched pairs of actions on
Hopf algebras. We further prove that cocommutative Yetter–Drinfeld braces
(equivalently, cocommutative Hopf braces) form a semi-abelian category that is
also strongly protomodular, as is the case for the categories of groups, skew
braces, and cocommutative Hopf algebras. Moreover, under suitable assumptions
on the base field, we show that skew braces and post-Lie algebras can be used
to construct a torsion theory for this category. This talk is partially based
on a joint work with D. Ferri and on a joint work with M. Gran.

Different definitions of Nichols algebras  

Nichols algebras are certain braided Hopf algebras that play an
important role in the theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups.
Originally introduced by Nichols, they have since revealed themselves
as rich objects with applications far beyond Hopf algebra theory. In
this talk, I will briefly outline the different definitions of Nichols
algebras and explain why these definitions are equivalent.

On the total degree of a finite group  

For a finite group $G$, the total degree $T(G)$ is defined as the sum of the
degrees of the complex irreducible characters of $G$.  We classify the groups
with $T(G) \leq 100$, using computational methods, and investigate special
cases such as groups of prime power order and groups with total degree the
square of a prime.  (This is joint work with László Héthelyi, Burkhard
Külshammer, and Magdolna Szöke.)
